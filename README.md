# Covid_Telegram_Chatbot

The chabot is built using telegram as the messenger platform and python as the programming language.

It aims to provide the latest updates of COVID-19 cases in every country around the world. 

The user can write any country name and the bot will respond with the number of total cases, new cases, total Deaths, new deaths, total recovered, active cases, critical cases, and percentage of people infected at the moment on the total since the beginning.
